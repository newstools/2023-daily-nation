What you need to know:  Lisa’s* troubles started when her step-father said he could not educate a girl. She was only 13, and was about to join Form One.   Her dad kicked her out and she moved into a neighbour’s house.  On November 14, 2017,  her ‘sisters’ took her along to some cottages in Malindi town where they hooked her up with an old German tourist.Her elder ‘sister’ convinced her that there were wealthier and more generous foreign tourists in Tanzania.

What you need to know:  My name is Francis. I work as a matatu driver in Nairobi and earn at least Sh1200 per day. I work from Monday to Saturday. I have a wife and one child whom I support. My problem is that I can never account for my money and can't even explain where it goes. I really need to get my finances in order. Please help.

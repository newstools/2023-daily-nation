What you need to know:  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) is the first independent public office to exemplify the current threat to the rule of law.Since the UDA government came to power, ODPP has withdrawn almost all the corruption and murder cases against senior state and public officials, including the suspects appointed to the government.The line “there is no sufficient evidence” is just an excuse.

What you need to know:  They enhanced the feeling of the game and the worth of it. The players realised that they were doing something important by playing in front of 20,000. The fans’ presence is very important.I thank AFC branches’ coordinator Franklin “Kuka” Imbenzi for his diverse network with fans. Nothing beats the feeling of watching an AFC match in the stadium.

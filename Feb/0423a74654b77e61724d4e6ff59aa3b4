What you need to know:  The price of eggs has gone up in cities and major cities as the country faces an acute shortage of the usually cheap alternative source of protein. Many Kenyans are now forced to part with Sh320 to Sh340 for the smaller crate that carries 15 eggs. The price of a 30-egg crate ranges from Sh460 to Sh600. An egg at small retail shops is ranging between Sh15 and Sh20.

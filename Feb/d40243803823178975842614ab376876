What you need to know:  The southern African nation has been battling its worst cholera outbreak on record, with nearly 37,000 cases reported since March 2022.Confirmed cases have already been reported across the border in Mozambique, while the WHO said it assessed the current risk of spread inside Malawi and to other neighbouring countries as "very high".Since the outbreak began, Malawi has carried out two large vaccination campaigns, but due to limited supplies, has offered just one of the usually recommended two oral cholera vaccine doses.

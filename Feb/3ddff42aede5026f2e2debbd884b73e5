What you need to know:  Ranking of schools or students has zero educational value. It did not serve any rational educational purpose. Educational policy, curricula and standards do not provide for the ranking of schools or students. It is not the objective of a school-level examination to rank students. On the contrary, examinations provide critical feedback on the quality of teaching and learning experiences students have had over a period of time.

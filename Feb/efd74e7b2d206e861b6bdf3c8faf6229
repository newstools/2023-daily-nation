What you need to know:  It is in the nature of politics for office-seekers to promise the unrealistic, make it sound reasonable, and then when in power, refuse to acknowledge responsibility for what went wrong, instead apportioning blame to scapegoats.That seems to be what happened to the Kenya Kwanza government’s “bottom-up” development hoax conceived by a clique of political economy theorists.The idea sounded brilliant on the campaign trail but it has proved to be quite divorced from the truth.

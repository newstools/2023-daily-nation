What you need to know:  Cheruiyot, who gave out four balls to the team, challenged the national men's team to match their female counterparts who have dominated both the region and continent."We are here to support you. I know it's from the clubs that the national team is fed.  I see we have good players and I really hope that the tides will change so that the men's team can also shine," said the official.

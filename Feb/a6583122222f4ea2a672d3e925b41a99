What you need to know:  Fred Matiang’i’s story on how his home was allegedly attacked by police on Wednesday last week was imaginatively told.No images of the night attack were published and, this week, on Wednesday, police broke into the home of the former Interior cabinet secretary to retrieve the CCTV images of last week’s events.This week’s break-in took place in broad daylight and in the full glare of the media. It’s now likely, barring any legal challenges, the images of last week’s events will be made public.

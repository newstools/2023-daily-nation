What you need to know:  The Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition yesterday suffered a major setback in its bid to change its leadership in the Senate after the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal (PPDT) temporarily stopped communication of the proposed changes.The tribunal stopped the Senate Speaker from communicating the removal of Minority Whip Fatuma Dullo pending the hearing and determination of a petition filed before it by the Isiolo senator.This means the changes cannot be communicated before February 28, when further direction on the matter will be given.

What you need to know:  As we celebrate Estonia’s Independence Day tomorrow, we call upon the international community to condemn Russia, a UNSC permanent member, for pursuing its aggressive and outrageous breach of the UN Charter by invading its neighbour, Ukraine.Entrepreneurship cannot thrive without freedom—to choose your destiny, whom you want to cooperate with and the alliances you want to be in. Hence our support to Ukraine.We strongly condemn any breach of international treaties, the UN Charter and the use of force to change a country’s borders. No totalitarian leader should get away with that.

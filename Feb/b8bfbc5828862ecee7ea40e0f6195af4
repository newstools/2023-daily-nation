What you need to know:  The new school academic year has been met with a lot of confusion, especially around junior secondary school (JSS). Most schools have been without textbooks.But worse is having in JSS newly promoted teachers from the primary section and recruits who are not quite sure of what they are supposed to be doing.This is a crisis that was not entirely unexpected as the transition to the new Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) requires that teachers be trained in it to effectively handle the learners.

What you need to know:  Military jets had late yesterday afternoon started hovering over parts of the troubled Northern Rift Valley, signalling the arrival of Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) troops.The soldiers have been assigned to execute what has been described as a painful but decisive operation to rid the region of criminals behind the banditry menace.And while the decision has been welcomed by many, some residents, particularly in Baringo, were seen fleeing their homes, fearing ‘harassment’ during the joint exercise that will be carried out by KDF and police officers.

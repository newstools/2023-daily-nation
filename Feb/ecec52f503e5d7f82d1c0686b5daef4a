What you need to know:  Take the example of Prof Kindiki Kithure. He had every reason to be mad with Dr William Ruto in 2022. Between 2013 and 2017, he served as the majority leader of the Senate. On winning re-election in 2017, Uhuru and Ruto persuaded him to downgrade to the deputy speaker’s slot. He agreed grudgingly. He stuck with Ruto during the Jubilee split and lost his deputy speaker seat as a result.

What you need to know:  In this third, and last column in a series on life and mortality, I probe why and how we as mere mortals need to live a purpose-driven life.But to do so, we may want to suspend belief in the afterlife. That way, we live a life not incentivised by crass greed and selfishness about reward in the life yonder, if there’s one. I think of the human brain, the most important part of your anatomy, as a compartment of four co-equal cubicles. These four partitions are foundations of knowledge or ignorance.

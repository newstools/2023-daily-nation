What you need to know:  Sometimes Mother Earth decides without warning to do a shake from deep inside her bowels.The result is never pretty. If this happens undersea, you can get a catastrophic tsunami like the one which decimated the Indonesian island of Sumatra and killed over 200,000 people in 2004.If it’s on land, then you witness an earthquake such as devastated southern Turkey and northern Syria in the early hours of Monday.

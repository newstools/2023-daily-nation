What you need to know:  I follow, study and have published extensively on South Africa’s foreign policy. In a recent publication, Ramaphosa and a New Dawn for South African Foreign Policy, my co-editors and I point out that South Africa’s voting pattern in these instances should be read in the context of its declared foreign policy under the stewardship of President Cyril Ramaphosa.Like his predecessors, Ramaphosa’s policy encompasses at least five principles: pan-Africanism; South-South solidarity; non-alignment; independence; progressive internationalism.

What you need to know:  The Tana River Lodge was pulled into the sea.The nine cottages that stood on the 10-acre piece of land where the luxurious hotel sat were all washed into the sea in 2019, and the last bits in 2020. All that remains is what used to be the manager’s house, standing less than 50 meters from the sea, awaiting its fate.

What you need to know:  Kenyans and Tanzanians are these days given to asking sarcastic questions of people who come from countries that the same tough man has led for over 30 years.When you turn your back, some of them giggle. Neither country knows what the same president lording over a country for even 26 years means.In Kenya, Daniel arap Moi fell two years shy of 26 when he stepped down at the end of 2002. Counting his years as independence Prime Minister, Tanzania’s Mwalimu Julius Nyerere had also notched up 24 years when he retired in 1985.

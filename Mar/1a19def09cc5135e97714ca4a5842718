What you need to know:  In his appeal to be allowed to continue coaching Stars, Firat said Kenya has great potential in football.“To be honest, I see a big future and potential in this country…Remember I said that if I don’t see any future, then there is no need of staying. But these boys have shown the potential and that is all a coach can ask for and therefore I am interested to stay,” said Firat after their 2-1 win over Rwanda in Nairobi on November 15, 2021.

What you need to know:  Mr Akang’a appealed to the government to install lightning arrestors in primary schools because players use most of their playgrounds.“There is no FIFA law that says play must stop when it is raining, not unless the pitch is soaked with water to a point that players find it difficult to pass the ball. We therefore ask our authorities to ensure lightning arresters are installed in schools, churches and other buildings to reduce such cases from recurring,” the chairman said.

What you need to know:  On Wednesday, the government, for the first time since 2015, floated what it has christened “a government-to-government arrangement tender” that is deliberately structured and closed to restrict participation to state-owned national oil corporations of the Gulf States, such as Saudi Aramco, Emirates National Corporation and Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation.What has changed? Here is a bit of background. Since 2015, Kenya has been buying petroleum under what is known as the “Open Tender System (OTS)” which is co-ordinated by the Ministry of Energy.The tender is floated every month with 112 licensed oil marketing companies participating.
